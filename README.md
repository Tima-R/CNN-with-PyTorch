# CNN-with-PyTorch

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a kind of neural network that extracts features from matrices of numeric values (often images) by convolving multiple filters over the matrix values to apply weights and identify patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on in an image. The numeric representations of these patterns are then passed to a fully-connected neural network layer to map the features to specific classes.

## Environment

This project is developed and tested in Google Colab, which provides an excellent platform for running machine learning experiments with access to GPUs and TPUs. Below are the details of the environment and dependencies used:

- **Python Version**: Google Colab provides Python 3.7+
- **PyTorch Version**: 2.3.1
- **Torchvision Version**: 0.18.1
- **Torchaudio Version**: 2.3.1

### Requirements

To ensure compatibility and reproducibility, the following versions of PyTorch and its related libraries are used:

```sh
torch==2.3.1
torchvision==0.18.1
torchaudio==2.3.1
