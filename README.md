A convolutional neural network is a kind of neural network that extracts features from matrices of numeric values (often images) by convolving multiple filters over the matrix values to apply weights and identify patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on in an image.The numeric representations of these patterns are then passed to a fully-connected neural network layer to map the features to specific classes.
